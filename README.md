# WebsiteSearch
I discovered that some websites donâ€™t have good search functionality. This helps users find information on those websites more quickly. This application does this by extending the functionality of Ctrl+F to search current webpage and all of the links in the webpage.

# Mistakes
1. Opening new browser windows to browse links is not very elegant.
2. It is difficult to tell which links are the best, they should be sorted by relevancy or include a small snippet.
